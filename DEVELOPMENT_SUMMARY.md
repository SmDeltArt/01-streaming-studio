## üîç **Key Technical Decisions**

### **Why Simple Pixel-Based Positioning?**
- **Reason:** More reliable than percentage calculations
- **Benefit:** Consistent behavior across different iframe sizes
- **Trade-off:** Less flexible but more predictable

### **Why 20px Minimum Visibility?**
- **Reason:** Prevents cameras from disappearing completely
- **Benefit:** Always accessible for repositioning
- **Trade-off:** Slight positioning constraint for better UX

### **Why Focus on Core Features?**
- **Reason:** Stability and reliability over feature quantity
- **Benefit:** Solid foundation for future enhancements
- **Trade-off:** Some advanced features deferred
